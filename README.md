# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains all the assignments and lab practices I worked on while learning CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course. The code covers various topics such as programming fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, web development, databases, and more.

## Structure

Every assignment and lab exercise found in the course are found in the root folder. 

## About CS50

This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally.

- **Week 1: C**: Introduction to the C programming language. Learned about data types, control structures, loops, functions, and pointers.
- **Week 2: Arrays**: Introduction to arrays and memory management in C.
- **Week 3: Algorithms**: Introduction to algorithms and complexity analysis.
- **Week 4: Memory**: Introduction to memory management and data structures.
- **Week 5: Data Structures**: Introduction to data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables.
- **Week 6: Python**: Introduction to the Python programming language.
- **Week 7: SQL**: Introduction to SQL and databases.
- **Week 8: Flask**: Introduction to web development with Flask.
- **Week 9: Object-Oriented Programming**: Introduction to object-oriented programming with Python.

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/Mahider-T/CS50-.git


## "Why so many commits", you ask?
    CS50 Codespaces (a cloud-based version of Visual Studio Code for CS50) uses a bot to automatically commit every single change no matter the size. In case you were wondering.
